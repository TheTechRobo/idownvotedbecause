## Requesting quick answers adds noise {#introduction}
Stack Overflow is NOT a chat site, and not a forum. Refrain from adding unhelpful information like "this is urgent".

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Questions on Stack Overflow are never prioritised. Information such as "I am under a tight deadline" is not useful. Add only relevant information to your question. Also, you might pressure someone into answering if you make them feel bad (with "my manager is mad at me", et al), which is not what Stack Overflow is about.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
If you think a question is urgent, you can try Stack Overflow, but chats are much better for this purpose. Those are designed to give quick answers. Stack Overflow is meant for people to share information, not for you to get a quick and easy answer. Finally, things like "Please reply ASAP!" are not useful to future readers, which is the opposite of Stack Overflow's goal.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Please edit your question to remove the sense of urgency. Adding a bounty to your question may help to get quicker answers.
